## Introduction

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from an unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted. This C program visualizes the selection sort algorithm step by step using ASCII art, making it easier to understand the sorting process visually.

## Installation

To run the program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC. You can install GCC on Linux using the package manager of your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install GCC with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

Once you have GCC installed, you can compile the program using the following command:
```bash
make
```

## Usage 
```bash
./sort
```
